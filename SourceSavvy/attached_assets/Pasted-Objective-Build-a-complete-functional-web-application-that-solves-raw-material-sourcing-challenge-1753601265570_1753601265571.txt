Objective:
Build a complete, functional web application that solves raw material sourcing challenges for Indian street food vendors, focusing on a specific, validated pain point.

Problem Definition Requirements:

Conduct virtual user research by imagining interactions with 3 street food vendors in different regions (Mumbai chaat stall, Delhi paratha cart, Bangalore dosa stand)

Identify 5 key pain points in their current raw material procurement process

Select one core problem to solve (e.g., last-minute emergency supplies, quality verification, group purchasing)

Define 3 measurable success metrics for the solution

Solution Architecture:

Build a dual-interface platform (vendor + supplier sides)

Must include:

Real-time inventory management

Location-based supplier discovery

Price comparison engine

Documentation Requirements:

Video submission script outline:

0-60s: Problem story (show vendor struggles)

1-2m: Solution demo (key workflows)

2-3m: Technical highlights

3-4m: Impact potential

4-5m: Team reflection

GitHub repo must include:

Proper folder structure

README with setup instructions

License file

Evaluation Optimization:

Prioritize these fully-functional flows:
